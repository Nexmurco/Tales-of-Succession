# Event 11

As [[The Character|you]] lay for the night, you start to feel the full weight of the day. Falling down a [[The Waterfall|waterfall]] took more out of you than you realized. Your stomach is full from [[Waterfall Group Meal|the meal]] you just shared with [[The Group by the Waterfall|these three strangers]]. You feel the warmth of [[Waterfall Group Campfire|the fire]] beside you as you slowly let your eyes close. Next thing you know, it is morning. You rub the crust from your eyes, with a foggy mind as you slept much longer than you are used to. You blink through the grogginess and attempt to survey your surroundings. The men you met the night before are nowhere in sight, and the campsite has disappeared. If it weren’t for the fizzled embers of the fire that had kept you warm throughout the night, you’d be sure you dreamt the entire encounter. Confused, you start to gather your things to be on your way. You grab your [[The Sword of the Rusted Statue|sword]] and go to reach for [[The Diamond Shaped Key|the key]] that you had concealed the night before, but you find [[The Case of Keys|the box]] empty. You hear the rustling of leaves in the distance to your left. On your right, you see [[Waterfall Path|a path]] that seems to lead into [[The Waterfall Town|town]]. 
Do you:

- head in the direction you heard movement in the distance to try and catch up with the three men? 
- Maybe travel into town to try and recoup and gather more supplies?
- Or take some time searching the campsite in case you dropped your key somewhere along the way?
