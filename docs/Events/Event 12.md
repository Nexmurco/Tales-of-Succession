# Event 12

The chase: 
Filled with righteous fury at the loss of your [[The Diamond Shaped Key|precious key]], you put the [[The Case of Keys|key box]] in your [[Starting Clothes|pocket]] and begin tracking [[The Brigands|the bastards]] who stole the golden man’s gift. As [[The Character|you]] follow through the brush, you are able to pick up a slight trail, and though your tracking skills are not top notch, your quarry has been careless and not made any attempts to cover their tracks. As you go however, your surroundings begin to warp and twist, and you know your [[The Golden Trail|trail]] is correct because you can once again see the [[The Gold Dimension|golden dimension’s]] influence manifest. Veins of gold seem to run through the path the brigands have tread, with leaves twinkling unnaturally and the sky tinted yellow. After about half a day’s walk, now hungry and angrier than ever, you’ve tracked down the three men, only no longer do they appear to you as men. While not seeming to have skin of pure gold like the gift-giver, they’ve taken on a jaundiced yellow skin tone, their posture has become hunched, and their teeth which once seemed normal are now gnarled and twisted. They are camped in the [[Gold Dimension Clearing|clearing]], and they have [[Brigand's Packs|supply packs]] resting near the edge while they make lunch. 
Do you try to:

- Rifle through the packs and steal your key (and anything else valuable looking) while avoiding notice 
- Charge into camp, murder them all, and help yourself to all your own belongings as well as theirs
