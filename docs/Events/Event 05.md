[[The Character|You]] reach to the right and take [[The Case of Keys|the glass box]]. As you lift it off [[The Platinum Tray|the tray]] you immediately feel its' weightlessness. You glance back up to [[The Golden Man|the golden man]] but find he has completely disappeared. Behind where he stood you see a [[The Ladder of the Golden Chamber|ladder]], leading upwards into the light, as well as downwards into darkness. Behind you, [[The Rusted Statue|the statue]] seems even more rusted than before. Do you take a closer look at the glass box and [[The Diamond Shaped Key|the key]] inside, take the ladder up, take the ladder down, or turn around and inspect [[The Sword of the Rusted Statue|the sword]]?
