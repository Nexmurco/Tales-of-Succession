#Gavin #Event 
The [[The Abyssal Waters|strong current]] overwhelms [[The Character|you]]. You begin to toss and tumble in the water. While you’re hold your breath, you flail your arms in desperation to grab onto anything you can find - no luck. Ahead of you, you hear the roaring sound of water falling. Listening closer, you can almost hear the soothing sound of [[Waterfall Hummingbirds|humming birds]] past the [[The Abyssal Waterfall|waterfall]]. “Maybe I can survive the waterfall, and get out of this current.” you think to yourself. As you get closer and closer, a hand grips onto yours tightly. “[[The Group by the Abyssal Waterfall|We]] got him!” [[The Man by The Abyssal Waterfall|a man]] shouts from above the water. “Now PULL.” he says. 
Do you break from of the man’s grip, and continue your decent to the waterfall? Or do you embrace the man’s grip, and hope he’s an ally?
