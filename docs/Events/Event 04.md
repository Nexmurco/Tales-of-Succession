# Event 04

As [[The Character|you]] walk to the [[The Golden Man|golden man]], you begin to hear something. Though his mouth never opens, a melody plays within the air. The golden man brings you closer with a look from his piercing eyes that match the color of the [[The Platinum Tray|tray]] he holds. You draw closer to him, the [[The Song of the Golden Man|song]] growing only louder. When you stand before him, you realize now how much taller he is than you. He leans over you and opens his mouth. The music abruptly ends. In its place is a whisper from the man. One you do not hear with your ears, but hear in your mind. 
"Traveler. A gift for your journey. Take only one." 
He lifts the tray after you hear these words. Upon the tray you see two separate items. On the left is an ornate, platinum [[The Platinum Mirror|mirror]] where the glass is pitch black. Upon its face, there is a cracked pattern. Gazing at the pattern, you feel a sense of recognition even though you have never seen this pattern before. On the right is a clear box [[The Case of Keys|case]] holding a single [[The Diamond Shaped Key|key]] within it, but having places for more keys inside. The one key you see is a simple gold that, upon peering closer through the glass, has teeth at the end that seem to be shifting in size and shape. The head of the key is shaped like a diamond. Do you:

- take the mirror
- **take the glass box**
- risk taking both
- turn around to inspect the copper [[The Rusted Statue|statue]] holding the [[The Sword of the Rusted Statue|sword]]
