# Event 01

[[The Character|You]] find yourself in a [[The Forest Clearing|small clearing in a forest]]. To your west there is a [[The Forest Path|winding path]]. The path seems to darken in the green shade of the canopy above. You see one very large [[The Golden Tree|tree]] with low hanging branches next to this path, the tree has a shimmering golden hue to its bark. To the east you can see clear sunlight and what appears to be the [[The Forest Edge|edge of the forest]]. You can hear the sound of a [[The River|river]] and maybe even a waterfall in that direction.
