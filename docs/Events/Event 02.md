# Event 02

[[The Character|You]] pause, carefully considering your next course of action. [[The Golden Tree|The tree]] seems to have an aura drawing you towards it. You slowly approach the tree as you inch closer, your heart races with anticipation. Upon inspection, you realize that bark is moving and golden light seems to pulse off of every individual piece of bark. You notice an anomaly among the strange formation of the tree is a branch that is curved in the fashion of a [[The Doorknob of the Golden Tree|doorknob]]. The peculiarity of the situation is becoming increasingly frustrating. Examining deeper might reveal something unfavorable, but with a potential reward that could be worthwhile. You contemplate your next move and come up with a couple of ideas:

- **press forward**
- retreat to where you heard the sound of a [[The River|river]]
- head back to [[The Town|town]] as to better prepare yourself. 
	- You have a [[Town Adventurers|couple of people]] you know that you could recruit to adventure with, however you would have to split any of the spoils you find. It could also be worth asking around to see if anyone has any information on the tree.
