# Event 09

Before [[The Character|you]] can even make a decision you’re ripped out of [[The Man by the Waterfall|the man’s]] grasp as you slam against a rock. Thankfully it’ll only bruise a bit, but before you can try to grab the rock you’re pulled closer to the [[The Abyssal Waterfall|waterfalls]] edge. There’s nothing you can do now but take a deep breath and hold on to the [[The Sword of the Rusted Statue|sward]] and the [[The Case of Keys|key box]] as you fall. The water washes you over the edge, roaring in your ears. For several moments you’re falling, disoriented, blind in the rush of water falling with you. Your heart beats frantically. Your lungs ache to breathe. And then you crash into the frothing water below you. The world goes dark outside of your closed eyelids and you thrash your arms wildly trying to right yourself. For a moment the sword begins to slip from your grasp, but you close your fist tight around it again. You pick a direction that you think is close to the direction you fell from and kick hard. Your lungs are running out of air but you keep pushing. And then you break the surface, gasping for air. Euphoria at having survived fills you for a moment before reality returns. You hear shouts and can hear [[The Group by the Waterfall|the people]] trying to make their way down to you. You still hold the sword and the key box. 
You can try to hide, or get ready to meet these people face on.
