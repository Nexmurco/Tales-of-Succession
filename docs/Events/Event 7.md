As [[The Character|you]] plummet through [[The Abyss|the abyss]], you can feel [[The Rust of the Statue|the rust]] falling off [[Starting Clothes|your clothes]] and clinging onto the walls. A knot forms in your chest, and you know there's no turning back now. The air grows colder with each passing moment and time seems to stretch out before you. The roar of [[The Abyssal Waters|rushing water]] echoes in your ears, and you know that if you're going to survive this fall, you need to break the surface before impact breaks you. With a fierce determination, you grip [[The Sword of the Rusted Statue|your sword]] tightly and thrust it downward, just as the cold, glassy surface of the water envelops you. The icy embrace steals the breath from your lungs you sink down and swim hard to get back to the surface while still clutching [[The Case of Keys|the box]] and [[The Sword of the Rusted Statue|sword]] . But you're not going to let this be the end. You kick and stroke, fighting the current that threatens to pull you under. As you break the surface and gasp for air, you can't help but feel a thrill of excitement. You've faced death and emerged victorious. But be warned, adventurer. The current is strong and it's not done with you yet. You can either:
- swim upwards and fight against the current
- stop fighting and embrace the flow
