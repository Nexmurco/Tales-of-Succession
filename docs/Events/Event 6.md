Your curiosity of the [[The Sword of The Rusted Statue|sword]] is too great to ignore now that the[[The Case of Keys|key box]] is in your hand. You carefully inspect the [[The Rusted Statue|statue]] but find nothing of note. You turn to approach the [[The Ladder of the Golden Chamber|ladders]] before looking at the sword one last time. Overcome with greed, you rip the sword from the statue and run for the ladders in an attempt to avoid any traps or punishment. As you yank the sword free of the statue's grip it rapidly disintegrates into a cloud of rust flakes that cling to your skin and clothes. Coughing hard seems to clear your lungs. Still fearing some dark reprisal, you rush towards the ladder leading down. With the key box in one hand and the sword in the other... how will you descend?

- Climb down carefully while holding both the key box and the sword 
- Try and store them before descending
- Remember you are a filthy Link main and Down air with the sword and key box
