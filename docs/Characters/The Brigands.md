# The Brigands

A group of people [[The Character]] met when caught in the current taking them down [[The Waterfall]]. One of the group members (it is unknown which) tried to catch The Character, but was unable to. After The Character fell down the waterfall, the group followed. The character met three of them:
- [[Fredric]]
- [[Rickert]]
- [[Kane]]
The character wondered if there might be more to the group than just the three. After meeting them, the 3 invited [[The Character]] to rest and eat with them at their [[Brigand Campfire|campfire]]. After spending the night, [[The Character]] found that [[The Diamond Shaped Key]] was missing and the 3 men had disappeared.
[[The Character]] followed their trail through twisting of dimensions and was led to a [[Gold Dimension Clearing|clearing]] where they had broken camp. [[The Character]] saw the men now had a changed appearance: jaundiced yellow skin, hunched posture, and gnarled teeth.
