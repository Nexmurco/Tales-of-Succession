# The Group by the Waterfall

A group of people [[The Character]] met when caught in the current taking them down [[The Waterfall]]. One of the group members (it is unknown which) tried to catch The Character, but was unable to. After The Character fell down the waterfall, the group followed. The character met three of them:
- [[Fredric]]
- [[Rickert]]
- [[Kane]]
The character wondered if there might be more to the group than just the three.
