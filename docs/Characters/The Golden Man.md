#Character #Person 
The Golden Man was an entity found in [[The Golden Chamber]] across from [[The Rusted Statue]]. He is much taller and larger than [[The Character]]. He held [[The Platinum Tray]]. He has golden skin, sharp pearl teeth, and eyes colored the same platinum as [[The Platinum Tray]]. He speaks to The Character, though he does not produce soundwaves and audible words and communicates through some sort of telepathy. Additionally, music was mysteriously produced before him speaking, and he seems to have some sort of supernatural charm or allure to his eyes and gaze.
The Golden Man offers The Character a gift for their journey either [[The Platinum Mirror]] or [[The Case of Keys]] and tells them to only take one.
After the character decides to take the case, the golden man disappears and is replaced by [[The Ladder of the Golden Chamber]].
