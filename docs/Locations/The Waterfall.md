# The Waterfall

After entering [[The Abyss]] and being caught in the current of [[The Abyssal Waters]], [[The Character]] was swept toward this waterfall, which they plummeted down, but survived. There is a [[Waterfall Path|path]] near it that leads to [[The Waterfall Town]] It is uncertain (as of [[Event 10]]) if this waterfall is the same one that could have been near [[The River]] that was outside [[The Forest]].
