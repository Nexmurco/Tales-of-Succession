# The Abyssal Waters - The Waterfall River

After leaving [[The Golden Chamber]] and descending into [[The Abyss]], [[The Character]] landed in the abyssal waters. This either was a river, or transported [[The Character]] to a river that lead to [[The Waterfall]]. It is uncertain (as of [[Event 10]]) if this river is [[The River|the same one]] that was outside [[The Forest]] (from [[Event 01]])
