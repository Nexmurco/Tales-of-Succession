# The Door of the Golden Tree

A doorway through [[The Golden Tree]]. Upon inspecting the tree, [[The Character]] found they had gone through without recollection, caused by some entrancing effect from seeing the  [[Text of the Golden Tree]]. Although no actual door was seen from the exterior of the tree (due to being mesmerized), the character saw themselves closing it from inside [[The Golden Chamber]]
