# Text of the Golden Tree

Upon inspecting [[The Golden Tree]] the tree began projecting images and text of light. [[The Character]] was not able to understand the text, but was able to see an array of people and animals. Some of which were recognizable and some of which were completely unknown. The text apparently was mesmeric, as the character found they had gone through [[The Door of the Golden Tree]] after witnessing the text and images.
